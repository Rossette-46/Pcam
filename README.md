# PatchCamelyon
In this project, I developed a Convolutional Neural Network model using TensorFlow and Keras to classify metastasis in cancer cell images from the PatchCamelyon dataset. The model architecture includes convolutional, 
pooling, and dense layers for feature extraction and classification. I trained this model on large dataset, using h5py to handle the data. Achieved an accuracy of approximately 78% on the test set.
